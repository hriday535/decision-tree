decision tree

Project Description: A credit card company wants to analyze its previous campaign data to identify potential responders for upcoming cross sell offer for customers having loan (we have attributes age, credit history, good bad and duration.)

•	Import and load the data on file icon after pulling it on decision tree building page
•	bring data table icon and connect to file and set target variable
•	Select one after another Gini, Chi square etc. on the attributes selection criterion on classification tree table and compare the business rules, choose reduction in variance if target variable is continuous.
•	Choose minimum instances to build the decision tree as 15,then bring the classification tree graph on to the decision tree building page and connect to classification tree icon, now if the tree looks cumbersome or bigger then increase minimum number of instances to 40
•	We can choose target class probability once we get the tree, from the tree, we should be able to identify the best rule out of possible rules to go with and to determine the default.
